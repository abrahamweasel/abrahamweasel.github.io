<h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
<em>Hau mitakuyepi, Chante wasteya napechiyuzape. Lakhotia Chetan Okan Iga emacicyapi na wasicuyapi Abraham Weasel emaciyapi. Lakhota wichasa hemacha yelo na Inyan woslal han ematanhan.</em>
Hello relatives, I shake your hand with a good heart. My Lakota name is Circling Hawk and my white name is Abraham Weasel. I am a Lakota man and I am from Standing Rock.
I come from a family of seven, where everyone has gone to college and earned their degree. I want to follow their footsteps and earn a degree of my own, which is why I am here today.
<h3>Education Background</h3>
I graduated as an honor's student from Standing Rock High School in Fort Yates, North Dakota. I enrolled into Sitting Bull College (in Fort Yates also) that following fall where I ended my first college semester on the President's List with 4.0 GPA. Personal family issues happen of course where I took a semester break during Spring 2023. I transferred to United Tribes Technical College in Fall 2023. I was doing my two years in General Studies up until I met the IT instructor and I fell in love with the computer classes. I ended up switching my degree to Computer Information Technology, as it sparked my reinterest in technology from when I was young.

<h3>What I look forward to in the ESIIL program</h3>
I always love meeting new people and working as a team/group with others. I am ready to learn more about coding, especially using Python as I know it will be beneficial to my degree and my future.

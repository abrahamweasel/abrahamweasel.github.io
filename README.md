<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><em>Hau mitakuyepi, Chante wasteya napechiyuzape. Lakhotia Chetan Okan Iga emacicyapi na wasicuyapi Abraham Weasel emaciyapi. Lakhota wichasa hemacha yelo na Inyan woslal han ematanhan.</em>
Hello relatives, I shake your hand with a good heart. My Lakota name is Circling Hawk and my white name is Abraham Weasel. I am a Lakota man and I am from Standing Rock.</p>
<h3>Education Background</h3>
<p>I come from a family of seven, where everyone has gone to college and earned their degree. I want to follow their footsteps and earn a degree of my own, which is why I am here today. I graduated as an honor's student from Standing Rock High School in Fort Yates, North Dakota. I enrolled in Sitting Bull College (Fort Yates also) that following fall where I ended my first college semester on the President's List with 4.0 GPA. At first, I wanted to do my two years of General Studies, but my IT instructor influenced me into going into her program. Thus, I ended up switching my degree to Computer Information Technology. I transferred to United Tribes Technical College in Fall 2023. I am glad I did because not only did it spark my reinterest in technology, I met a lot of amazing people and got more opportunities.</p>
<h3>What I look forward to in the ESIIL program</h3>
<p>I always loved meeting new people and working as a team/group with others. I am ready to learn more about coding, especially using Python as I know it will be beneficial to my degree and my future.</p>

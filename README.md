Hello relatives, I shake your hand with a good heart. My Lakota name is Circling Hawk and my white name is Abraham Weasel. I am a Lakota man and I am from Standing Rock.
<br/>
I live in McLaughlin, South Dakota with my family. I graduated from Standing Rock High School in Fort Yates, North Dakota. I attended Sitting Bull College where I transferred to United Tribes Technical College in Fall 2023. I am pursuring my degree in Computer Information Technology, as I always an interests in computers from when I was young.
